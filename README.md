# What is it?

This simple formula:

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 2rem;">

$f = p - \frac{1-p}{b}$

</div>

answers an amazingly complex question:

> Given a change to place a bet, at a given odds (payoff for a win), and a given
> probability of winning; how much of my money (stake) should I put at risk
> each time I place a bet?
